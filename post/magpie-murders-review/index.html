My to-read list has been piling up for years, and between full-time work and kids, I barely finish anything these days - except maybe the odd Andy Weir when I&rsquo;m lucky. Yes, I did manage to knock out <em>Project Hail Mary</em> in two weeks, but that&rsquo;s the exception.</p><p>So there I was at a thrift store in Chennai, managing my kids&rsquo; time at the mall, browsing through books with one eye. &ldquo;Murders&rdquo; and &ldquo;Anthony Horowitz&rdquo; caught my attention. I remembered the name from years ago when he wrote <em>The House of Silk</em>, a new Sherlock mystery. The book was in decent shape - a paperback, though the back cover was pretty torn. I bargained with the vendor and got it at a steal.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always been a reluctant reader the last few years, but whodunits by Agatha Christie have been my thing since I was younger. I&rsquo;ve read almost all of the Poirot and Marple mysteries. For some reason, the dull English country setting in each of the Poirot mysteries has always kept my attention up. I even have this ritual - finish the book, then catch up on the drama adaptation. The folks at ITV and BBC did a wonderful job with most of the Poirot adaptations.</p><p>I was immediately hooked to <em>Magpie Murders</em>. The whole plot-within-a-plot was pretty novel to me, and though I only managed about 40 pages during my time at the mall, I decided for some reason to finish this one. Kept it on my worktable for the next few weeks.</p><p>Right from the plot leading up to the murder, I couldn&rsquo;t distinguish it from a Poirot mystery - except maybe the murder is a little more gruesome than Christie&rsquo;s. This was my first Atticus Pünd mystery, but the comparison was obvious: Poirot ↔ Pünd, Hastings ↔ Fraser, Inspector Japp ↔ Chubb.</p><p>The novelty is in the typeface changes. You&rsquo;re reading the 1950s murder mystery, completely absorbed, heading toward that classic moment where the detective gathers everyone to reveal the killer. And then - right before the revelation chapter - we switch back to the present.</p><p>Now we&rsquo;re chasing a completely different mystery, driven in first person by the editor who&rsquo;s worked on every Atticus Pünd book written by Alan Conway. The final chapter of the manuscript is missing, and she&rsquo;s trying to figure out what happened to Conway. What made this really interesting is that the book is pretty self-aware - it references Poirot and openly discusses the similarities with Agatha Christie&rsquo;s whodunits. The genius is in how clues hidden in the Pünd mystery become essential to solving the real-world case.</p><p>It took me close to six weeks to finish. Normally I&rsquo;d manage an Agatha Christie whodunit within the week. This may feel like a pretty long duration to an avid reader, but remember - my reading cycle is quite off, and I&rsquo;m just getting back into the groove.</p><p>Definitely recommend this to anyone who&rsquo;s read at least one Christie or Poirot mystery, or for any true crime fan in general. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be reading another of Pünd&rsquo;s mysteries in the near future, but it was a pretty good experience.</p><p>More importantly, it got me reading again. I&rsquo;ve already lined up <em>Dark Matter</em> by Blake Crouch and <em>The Secret of Secrets</em> by Dan Brown for the coming weeks. And I can&rsquo;t wait to catch up on the ITV mini-series adaptation of <em>Magpie Murders</em> as well. Here&rsquo;s hoping the momentum holds.</p></div><footer class="post-footer clearfix"><p class=post-tags><span>Tagged:</span>
