My to-read list has been piling up for years, and between full-time work and kids, I barely finish anything these days - except maybe the odd Andy Weir when I&amp;rsquo;m lucky. Yes, I did manage to knock out &lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt; in two weeks, but that&amp;rsquo;s the exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there I was at a thrift store in Chennai, managing my kids&amp;rsquo; time at the mall, browsing through books with one eye. &amp;ldquo;Murders&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Anthony Horowitz&amp;rdquo; caught my attention. I remembered the name from years ago when he wrote &lt;em&gt;The House of Silk&lt;/em&gt;, a new Sherlock mystery. The book was in decent shape - a paperback, though the back cover was pretty torn. I bargained with the vendor and got it at a steal.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
